# Indore AERMOD Source Apportionment

This project includes outputs from AERMOD dispersion modeling used to estimate source contributions to PM concentrations in Indore.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Quantify contributions from major sources to PM2.5 and PM10 levels.
- Visualize modeled concentration fields and source shares.

## 🛠 Methods Overview

- Emission inventory preparation.
- AERMOD simulation runs.
- Post-processing of modeled outputs.

## 📈 Sample Outputs

- Gridded PM2.5 and PM10 concentration maps.
- Pie charts of source contributions.
- Comparative plots with observed data.

## 📝 Notes

Detailed modeling files are not included in this repository.
