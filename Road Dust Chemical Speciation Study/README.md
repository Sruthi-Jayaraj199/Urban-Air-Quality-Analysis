# Road Dust Chemical Speciation Study

This project documents chemical speciation analysis of road dust samples to support source apportionment studies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Characterize chemical composition of road dust.
- Support receptor modeling and source identification.

## 🛠 Methods Overview

- Sampling of road dust across urban locations.
- Chemical analysis of elemental composition.
- Data visualization of species profiles.

## 📈 Sample Outputs

- Bar charts of elemental concentrations.
- Contribution profiles by location.
- Comparison plots with literature profiles.

## 📝 Notes

Detailed datasets are not included in this repository.
