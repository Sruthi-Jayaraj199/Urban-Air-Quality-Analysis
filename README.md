# Urban-Air-Quality-Analysis
This repository contains the descriptions of the work and sample outputs demonstrating workflows for air quality monitoring, modeling, and analysis from my ongoing projects at WRI India.

**üìÇ Project Folders Overview**

**Mumbai Ambient Air Quality Analysis**

-Data processing and trend analysis of ambient PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ and PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ concentrations in Mumbai.

-Code for generating time-series plots, diurnal/seasonal patterns, and comparisons across monitoring stations.

-This work will be expanded to additional cities in the ACAAS program.

**Agra Mobile Monitoring Exposure Study**

-Mobile monitoring campaigns to assess on-road exposure to particulate matter.

-Scripts for merging sensor and GPS data, temporal aggregation, and spatial visualization of exposure profiles.

**Indore AERMOD Source Apportionment**

-Emission inventory preparation and dispersion modeling using AERMOD.

-Estimation of source contributions to PM concentrations across Indore.

**Mumbai Multi-Modal Exposure Assessment**

-Comparative analysis of PM exposures across different commuting modes (e.g., bus, car, walking).

-Data processing workflows for multi-modal monitoring campaigns.

**Road Dust Chemical Speciation Study**

-Chemical characterization of road dust samples to support source apportionment.

-Scripts for statistical analysis of species profiles and receptor modeling inputs.

**Chennai Low-Cost Sensor Deployment Strategy**

-Identification of optimal locations for LCS network deployment based on land use, population density, and emission hotspots.

-Mapping and prioritization workflows.
