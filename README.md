# Urban-Air-Quality-Analysis
This repository contains the descriptions of the work and sample outputs demonstrating workflows for air quality monitoring, modeling, and analysis from my ongoing projects at WRI India.

**üìÇ Project Folders Overview**

**1. Mumbai Ambient Air Quality Analysis**

- Data processing and trend analysis of ambient PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ and PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ concentrations in Mumbai.

- Code for generating time-series plots, diurnal/seasonal patterns, and comparisons across monitoring stations.

- This work will be expanded to additional cities in the ACAAS program.

**2. Agra Mobile Monitoring Exposure Study**

- Mobile monitoring campaigns to assess on-road exposure to particulate matter.

- Scripts for merging sensor and GPS data, temporal aggregation, and spatial visualization of exposure profiles.

**3. Indore AERMOD Source Apportionment**

- Emission inventory preparation and dispersion modeling using AERMOD.

- Estimation of source contributions to PM concentrations across Indore.

**4. Mumbai Multi-Modal Exposure Assessment**

- Comparative analysis of PM exposures across different commuting modes (e.g., bus, car, walking).

- Data processing workflows for multi-modal monitoring campaigns.

**5. Road Dust Chemical Speciation Study**

- Chemical characterization of road dust samples to support source apportionment.

- Analysis of various sources contributing to road dust and optimization of parameters to identify a suitable cleaning mechanism. 

**6. Chennai Low-Cost Sensor Deployment Strategy**
 
- Identification of optimal locations for LCS network deployment based on land use, population density, and emission hotspots.

- Mapping and prioritization workflows.
